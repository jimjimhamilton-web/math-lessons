        <h2 id="sec-1-1">1.1 Why Did Humans Invent Trigonometry?</h2>
        
        <p>
            Imagine standing at the base of the Great Pyramid of Giza around 2550 BCE. You're an Egyptian architect, and the pharaoh wants to know: "How tall is my pyramid?" You could try climbing the 481-foot monument and dropping a rope... or you could measure a shadow and do some clever mathematics.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the kind of problem that led humans to develop trigonometry. The word itself comes from Greek: <em>trigonon</em> (triangle) and <em>metron</em> (measure)—literally "triangle measurement." But trigonometry turned out to be far more than just measuring triangles. It became one of the most powerful and widely-used branches of mathematics, essential for understanding everything from the motion of planets to the design of smartphones.
        </p>

        <div class="historical">
            <h3 id="subsec-the-ancient-problems-that-demanded-solutions">The Ancient Problems That Demanded Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                Ancient civilizations faced practical problems that required measuring things they couldn't directly reach:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Architecture and Construction (3000-2000 BCE):</strong> Egyptian and Babylonian builders needed to ensure their massive structures were properly aligned and proportioned. The pyramids are aligned to true north with remarkable precision (within 0.05 degrees). This required understanding angles and their relationship to distances.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2. Astronomy and Timekeeping (2000-1000 BCE):</strong> Predicting seasons was essential for agriculture. Ancient astronomers needed to track the sun, moon, and stars, which meant measuring angles between celestial objects and calculating their distances and movements. The Babylonians divided the circle into 360 degrees around 1500 BCE, a convention we still use today.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. Navigation (1000 BCE onwards):</strong> Sailors needed to determine their position at sea. By measuring the angle of the North Star above the horizon, they could determine their latitude. But this required mathematical tables relating angles to positions—the beginnings of trigonometry.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. Surveying and Land Measurement:</strong> How do you measure the size of a field with irregular boundaries? How do you determine property boundaries on hilly terrain? These practical problems required methods to calculate distances indirectly using angles.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="sec-1-2">1.2 The Historical Development: A 4000-Year Journey</h2>

        <p>
            Trigonometry didn't appear fully formed. It developed gradually over thousands of years, with contributions from civilizations across the ancient world. Let's follow this remarkable journey:
        </p>

        <h3 id="subsec-the-babylonian-foundation-1900-1600-bce">The Babylonian Foundation (1900-1600 BCE)</h3>
        
        <div class="historical">
            <p>
                The Babylonians, in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), were master astronomers. They kept detailed records of celestial phenomena for over a thousand years. Clay tablets from this period show they understood:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The 360-degree division of a circle (possibly based on their approximation that a year has 360 days)</li>
                <li>Methods for calculating the length of daylight throughout the year</li>
                <li>Early versions of what we'd call trigonometric relationships, though they didn't express them with functions as we do today</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                They created extensive tables relating angles to lengths, which they used for astronomical calculations. One famous tablet, Plimpton 322 (circa 1800 BCE), contains what appears to be a sophisticated table of values that may represent early trigonometric relationships.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="subsec-greek-geometry-and-astronomy-300-bce-300-ce">Greek Geometry and Astronomy (300 BCE - 300 CE)</h3>

        <div class="historical">
            <p>
                The Greeks made trigonometry more systematic and rigorous:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hipparchus (190-120 BCE):</strong> Often called the "father of trigonometry," Hipparchus created the first trigonometric table. He was trying to solve a practical problem: predicting the positions of the sun and moon with enough accuracy to forecast eclipses. His tables related angles to chord lengths in circles, which could then be used to solve astronomical problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Ptolemy (100-170 CE):</strong> In his great work the <em>Almagest</em>, Ptolemy refined and extended Hipparchus's tables. The <em>Almagest</em> was not just a book of astronomy—it was a complete mathematical toolkit for calculating the positions of celestial objects. It dominated astronomy for over 1400 years and was essential reading for anyone studying the heavens.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Greeks viewed trigonometry primarily as a tool for astronomy, not as a separate branch of mathematics. Their approach was geometrical—they thought in terms of chords in circles rather than the sine and cosine functions we use today.

        <h2 id="sec-1-3">1.3 Why Does Trigonometry Matter Today?</h2>

        <p>
            You might wonder: "Okay, trigonometry has an impressive history, but why should I learn it in 2025?" The answer is that trigonometry has become more relevant, not less, as technology has advanced.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subsec-everywhere-you-look">Everywhere You Look</h3>

        <p>
            Consider your typical day. Trigonometry is working behind the scenes in:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Your Smartphone:</strong> GPS calculates your position using trigonometry to triangulate signals from satellites. Your phone's accelerometer and gyroscope use trigonometry to determine which way you're holding it. Computer graphics rendering (when you play a game or view a 3D map) uses trigonometry to calculate angles, distances, and rotations thousands of times per second.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Music and Audio:</strong> When you stream music, you're hearing the result of trigonometry. All sound waves can be decomposed into sine waves of different frequencies—a discovery by the mathematician Joseph Fourier. MP3 compression, noise cancellation in headphones, audio equalization—all rely on representing sounds as combinations of trigonometric functions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Buildings and Bridges:</strong> Every structure around you was designed using trigonometry. Engineers calculate loads, stresses, and angles to ensure buildings are safe and stable. The roof over your head, the bridge you drive over—their designs depend on trigonometric calculations.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Physics and Engineering:</strong> Anything that involves rotation, oscillation, or waves requires trigonometry. Electrical engineers use it to analyze alternating current. Mechanical engineers use it to understand gear systems and mechanisms. Physicists use it to describe everything from pendulums to planetary orbits to quantum mechanics.
        </p>

        <div class="example">
            <h3 id="subsec-a-concrete-example-video-game-physics">A Concrete Example: Video Game Physics</h3>
            <p>
                Imagine you're creating a simple basketball game. When the player shoots the ball, you need to calculate where it will land. The ball follows a parabolic arc—its path is determined by trigonometry:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The initial velocity has horizontal and vertical components: $v_x = v \cos(\theta)$ and $v_y = v \sin(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the launch angle</li>
                <li>The ball's position at any time requires calculating distances using these trigonometric components</li>
                <li>Detecting when the ball hits the rim or goes through the hoop requires calculating angles between the ball's position and the basket</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Even this simple game physics simulation requires several trigonometric calculations every frame (potentially 60 times per second). More realistic physics—with spin, air resistance, and accurate collision detection—requires even more sophisticated trigonometry.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="sec-1-4">1.4 The Core Idea: Relationships in Triangles</h2>

        <p>
            At its heart, trigonometry is about a simple but powerful insight: <em>In right triangles, the ratios of the side lengths depend only on the angles, not on the size of the triangle</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider any right triangle with a 30-degree angle. Regardless of whether the triangle has sides of 1 cm, 1 meter, or 1 kilometer, the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse is always the same: approximately 0.5. This ratio is so fundamental that we give it a name: sine of 30 degrees, written $\sin(30°) = 0.5$.
        </p>

        <p>
            This means we can create tables or functions that tell us these ratios for any angle. Once we know the ratios, we can solve countless practical problems:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Knowing one angle and one side of a triangle, we can find all the other sides</li>
            <li>Knowing the sides, we can find the angles</li>
            <li>We can calculate heights of buildings from shadows, distances across lakes, paths of projectiles, and much more</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In Module 2, we'll define these ratios precisely and learn how to work with them. For now, just appreciate that this simple geometric insight—that angle-side ratios are constant—is the foundation for all of trigonometry's power.
        </p>

        <h2 id="sec-1-5">1.5 The Remarkable Power of Sine and Cosine</h2>

        <p>
            Here's something truly amazing about trigonometry: those ratios we define for right triangles (sine and cosine) turn out to be far more fundamental than just tools for triangle measurement. They describe something deep about oscillation and periodicity in mathematics.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subsec-fourier-s-revolutionary-insight">Fourier's Revolutionary Insight</h3>

        <p>
            In 1822, French mathematician Joseph Fourier discovered something extraordinary: <em>any smooth periodic function—no matter how complicated—can be represented as a sum of simple sine and cosine waves</em>. This idea, called Fourier analysis, is one of the most important discoveries in mathematics.
        </p>

        <p>
            To understand why this matters, imagine you're trying to represent a complex sound wave, like someone speaking or music from an orchestra. The wave looks incredibly complicated—it's certainly not a simple sine wave. But Fourier proved that this complex wave is actually just the sum of many simple sine waves at different frequencies and amplitudes.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's as if you were looking at a complex painting, and Fourier told you: "That's not actually a single image—it's thousands of perfectly straight lines of different colors and thicknesses, layered on top of each other in just the right way to create what you see." And then he gave you a systematic method to figure out exactly which lines, in which amounts, to layer together to recreate any painting you want.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subsec-modern-applications-of-this-insight">Modern Applications of This Insight</h3>

        <p>
            Once you understand that complex patterns are sums of simple sine and cosine waves, you can do remarkable things:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Audio Compression (MP3, Spotify, etc.):</strong> When you stream music, the original audio signal contains thousands of sine waves at different frequencies. Fourier analysis identifies which frequencies are present—essentially creating a list that says "sine wave at 440 Hz with amplitude 0.7, plus sine wave at 880 Hz with amplitude 0.3..." and so on. The compression algorithm then discards frequencies that humans can't hear well (very high or very low frequencies, and frequencies masked by louder nearby frequencies). Your earbuds receive this simplified list of sine waves and reconstruct the sound. This is why an MP3 file is one-tenth the size of an uncompressed recording while sounding nearly identical.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Image Compression (JPEG):</strong> A photograph might look like a single complex entity, but it can be represented as a sum of cosine waves in two dimensions—a variant called the Discrete Cosine Transform. The JPEG algorithm identifies which cosine wave components contribute most to the image and discards less important ones (especially high-frequency components that represent fine details your eye doesn't notice). This is why a JPEG image is much smaller than an uncompressed bitmap while still looking sharp.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Wireless Communications:</strong> When your phone receives a WiFi or cellular signal, that electromagnetic wave is incredibly complex, potentially carrying many conversations and data streams simultaneously. Fourier analysis decomposes this wave into component frequencies, each carrying different bits of information. Multiple devices can share the same medium without interfering because they use different frequency ranges—different combinations of sine waves. Every form of wireless communication relies on this trigonometric foundation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subsec-a-glimpse-of-what-s-ahead">A Glimpse of What's Ahead</h3>

        <p>
            Full understanding of Fourier analysis requires calculus and goes well beyond this course. But in Module 7, we'll give you an introduction to Fourier's insight—not the complete mathematical machinery, but enough to understand why this idea is so powerful and how it connects to the trigonometric functions you'll learn in the coming modules.
        </p>

        <p>
            For now, don't worry if this seems mysterious—it should! We're giving you a glimpse of where trigonometry leads, not expecting you to understand it yet. What's important is recognizing that those seemingly simple functions you'll encounter in Module 2—sine and cosine, defined initially as ratios in right triangles—turn out to be the fundamental language of waves, oscillations, and periodic patterns throughout science and engineering.

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                <strong>The Deep Insight:</strong> Trigonometry isn't just a bag of useful tricks. It reveals something fundamental about the mathematical structure of reality. Sine and cosine are the building blocks from which all smooth, repeating patterns emerge. This is why trigonometry appears everywhere, from ancient astronomy to modern technology—these functions describe the basic "grammar" of oscillation and periodicity in our universe.

        <h2 id="sec-1-7">1.7 Closing Thoughts</h2>

        <p>
            Trigonometry began as a practical tool for ancient astronomers and navigators, but it became one of the most fundamental branches of mathematics. Its history spans four millennia and nearly every advanced civilization. Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Islamic scholars, and European mathematicians all contributed essential pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
            What makes this history remarkable is how each civilization built upon the work of previous ones. Indian mathematicians improved on Greek methods. Islamic scholars preserved and extended Indian and Greek knowledge. European Renaissance mathematicians translated and built upon Islamic texts. Mathematics is truly a universal human endeavor, transcending cultures and centuries.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, trigonometry is everywhere—in your phone's GPS, in the video games you might play, in the music you listen to, in the buildings around you, and in our understanding of the physical universe. What started as a way to measure triangles and track stars has become an indispensable tool for understanding and creating the modern world.
