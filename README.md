# math-lessons
A repository for my html math lessons

I'm preparing a set of math lessons.  They do not require a lot of pre-requisites, but are not entirely elementary.  So far there are four lessons, each with multiple modules.  The lessons cover elementary foundations, exponentials and logarithms, Trigonometry, and some historical preliminaries for calculus.
