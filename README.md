# math-lessons
A repository for my html math lessons

I'm preparing a set of math lessons.  They do not require a lot of pre-requisites, but are not entirely elementary.  So far there are two lessons, each with multiple modules.  The first is on exponentials and logarithms, and the second is on Trigonometry.  A third lesson will be on Calculus.  The calculus lesson will include a fairly extensive appendix discussing the real numbers.
